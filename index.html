<p> Robotics is a very entertaining and useful hobby that many kids participate in high school. I became very involved in robotics, specifically FIRST robotics during high school. I created a team, and in our rookie year, we qualified for the World Championships in St. Louis, MO. THe competition was held in the Edward Jones dome, the home of the St. Louis Rams, an NFL team. Through the robotics program, I learned a large amount of skills, including communication, leadership and teamwork. I am able to work very well in teams due to this program. <a href="www.usfirst.org">The program's website.</a></p>
